Command line:

Reading file umbrella20.tpr, VERSION 2018.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 20 to 100, rlist from 1.404 to 1.514


Will use 24 particle-particle and 8 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 32 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Green Red Orange Magenta Azure Cyan Skyblue in water'
50000000 steps,  50000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

 Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 0.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 90%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.400
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 13.3 %

NOTE: 13.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
