In order to study the effect of ageing on the sphericity of the condensates we run NVT simulations using the following files:

LAMMPS script: HPS_catpi_RNA_new.lmp (current directory)
Configuration file: conf.xyz (current directory)
Reaction maps: map* polimer* (Reaction files directory)

In the 'Output_example' directory, a sample NVT simulation is provided for the studied system (FUS-PLD at 320K).
Please note that the trajectory included only represents the first chunk of the whole simulation.
